Critical Infrastructure Protection Against Massive Cyber Attacks

The increasing integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology into
Industrial Control Systems (ICS) has significantly enhanced the capabilities
and efficiency of critical infrastructure systems. However, this integration has
also introduced new vulnerabilities, particularly to Distributed Denial of
Service (DDoS) attacks. This thesis focuses on detecting and defending
against DDoS attacks in critical infrastructure systems. It presents a
comprehensive study of the types and processes of DDoS attacks, their impact
on Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments, and the existing
mitigation strategies. The research employs advanced machine learning
models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), hybrid
CNN-LSTM and CNN-LSTM-GRU models, and federated learning
approaches, to effectively detect and mitigate these attacks. Experimental
vresults demonstrate the efficacy of these models in enhancing the security and
resilience of critical infrastructure systems.
